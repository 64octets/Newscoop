UPGRADE

Upgrading from versions 1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x and
2.5.x is not supported anymore. You will have to upgrade first to
Campsite 2.6 or 2.7 and then follow the regular procedure.

Upgrading from Campsite 2.6.x and 2.7.x versions:
Repeat the following steps for each instance:

1. Backup the instance using campsite-backup-instance
2. Perform a new Campsite 3.2 install
3. Run the restore backup script from the admin interface


Read INSTALL file and follow the steps; read on Compatibility issues.

Upgrading from Campsite 3.0.x, 3.1.x and 3.2.x:

Drop the 3.3 sources over the existing 3.0/3.1/3.2 install, open a
browser and make a request for the publication home page:
http://[site_name]

The upgrade will be performed automatically when you make the first
request to the publication site or to the Campsite admin interface.


Compatibility issues

In version 3.0 the template language was modified extensively. The
backup restore script will provide an automated conversion of the old
template files to the new format. For more details on language changes
please read the manual.

The 3.2 template language is fully backward compatible with versions
3.1 and 3.0. The 3.2 version only brings additions to the language.
