EXAMPLE TEMPLATES OF TRANSITIONS ONLINE

The following templates were created by Aleksandar 
Brajanoski <braja@ijt.cz>, webmaster of Transitions 
Online (http://www.tol.cz) who are running their 
application on CAMPFIRE and helped developing the 
software. The templates supplied here as examples are 
meant to illustrate the functionality of the CAMPSITE 
parser. 

Templates were frozen on the 15th of March 2001. 
Developed for CAMPSITE V1.0 (http://www.campware.org)
