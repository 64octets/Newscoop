PREPARATION - applications you need to have installed
  see the manual page at:

INSTALLATION - the usual procedure

1. Create an apache virtual host or use the default apache virtual
host. You may skip this step if you wanted to use the apache default
host (localhost).

Example of virtual host configuration:
<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/campsite
    ServerName [site_name]
    ServerAlias [site_alias]
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    <Directory /var/www/campsite>
            Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

2. Unzip and Untar the campsite file. This will generate a folder
named 'campsite'.

3. Change into the 'campsite' directory.

4. Copy the content of implementation/site directory into the document
root directory of the apache virtual host.

5. Start a browser, point it to the http://site_name URL and follow the
steps.

6. For Windows: Please rename htaccess file to .htaccess and be sure
your apache installation is able to read it in order for Campsite to
work well on this platform.

For Linux, FBSD: You can delete htaccess file if you want it, as it
is useless on these platforms.

INSTALLATION of multiple instances

Since version 3.0 Campsite doesn't support multiple instances anymore.
You will have to perform one install for each Campsite instance.
