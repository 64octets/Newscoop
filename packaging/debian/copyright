License: GPL-3
The Flowplayer Free version is released under the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 (GPL).
.
The GPL requires that you not remove the Flowplayer copyright notices
from the user interface. See section 5.d below.
.
Commercial licenses are available. The commercial player version
does not require any Flowplayer notices or texts and also provides
some additional features.
.
========================================================================
.
ADDITIONAL TERM per GPL Section 7
If you convey this program (or any modifications of it) and assume
contractual liability for the program to recipients of it, you agree
to indemnify Flowplayer, Ltd. for any liability that those contractual
assumptions impose on Flowplayer, Ltd.
.
Except as expressly provided herein, no trademark rights are granted in
any trademarks of Flowplayer, Ltd. Licensees are granted a limited,
non-exclusive right to use the mark Flowplayer and the Flowplayer logos
in connection with unmodified copies of the Program and the copyright
notices required by section 5.d of the GPL license. For the purposes
of this limited trademark license grant, customizing the Flowplayer
by skinning, scripting, or including PlugIns provided by Flowplayer, Ltd.
is not considered modifying the Program.
.
Licensees that do modify the Program, taking advantage of the open-source
license, may not use the Flowplayer mark or Flowplayer logos and must
change the fullscreen notice (and the non-fullscreen notice, if that
option is enabled), the copyright notice in the dialog box, and the
notice on the Canvas as follows:
.
the full screen (and non-fullscreen equivalent, if activated) notice
should read: "Based on Flowplayer source code"; in the context menu
(right-click menu), the link to "About Flowplayer free version #.#.#"
can remain. The copyright notice can remain, but must be supplemented with
an additional notice, stating that the licensee modified the Flowplayer. 
A suitable notice might read "Flowplayer Source code modified by ModOrg 2009";
for the canvas, the notice should read "Based on Flowplayer source code".
In addition, licensees that modify the Program must give the modified
Program a new name that is not confusingly similar to Flowplayer and
may not distribute it under the name Flowplayer.
.
