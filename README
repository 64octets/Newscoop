Campsite is a multilingual content management system (CMS) for news websites.

Campsite's user interface was built with the end user (journalist/editor/publisher) in mind and it can be scaled to suit different requirements and complexities. Campsite works best for medium-to-large-size online news publications, but it is capable of handling lighter sites too.  Campsite is developed by sourcefabric (http://www.sourcefabric.org)

Benefits:

    * Professional grade software that is free to download and easy to install.
    * User-friendly interface to allow journalists and editors to work efficiently.
    * Possibility for multi-lingual content comes as standard.
    * Management features designed specifically for newspapers: automation of issue publishing, editor review, multimedia support.
    * Subscription management with control over what content your subscribers have access to.
    * Total design freedom - make your site look however you like, utilising the templating engine.
