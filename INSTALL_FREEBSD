Additional installation notes for FreeBSD

BEFORE INSTALLATION:
1. Campsite requires that you have 'bash' installed, with the bash executable
located at /bin/bash. If you have installed bash from ports you may wish to
simply:
	ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash
2. Campsite requires that you have 'stat' installed. Stat is available from the
FreeBSD ports tree under sysutils/stat.
3. To build under FreeBSD, Campsite requires that you have 'gmake' installed.
gmake is available from the FreeBSD ports tree under devel/gmake.
4. You should of course ensure that all other required Campsite components
as listed in the Campsite manual (apache, mysql, php) are installed and
correctly configured.
5. It is recommended that you change the 'configure' file in the Campsite
directory so that the line:
	export CONF_DIR=$PREFIX/etc/campsite.d/$APP_NAME

is changed to:
	export CONF_DIR=/usr/local/etc/campsite.d/$APP_NAME

This ensures that Campsite config files are stored in /usr/local/etc instead
of /etc -- probably quite desirable on most FreeBSD systems.

INSTALLATION
Follow the installation guide in the Campsite manual -- the installation
procedure on FreeBSD is exactly the same. Pay particular attention to the
following, however:

1. The mysqld should be running before you attempt to install.
2. You should run the install script as root, either using su or sudo.
3. Be aware that the Campsite installer does its best to pick reasonable
defaults in the configuration of the various modules, but that these should
always be checked by the user. (This applies when installing Campsite on
any architecture). You can change all necessary variables interactively in
the installer.

In particular, note that:
	- PARSER_USER and PARSER_GROUP should be the same as the user and group
	  you use for apache.
	- ADMIN_INTERFACE_HTML_DIR, ADMIN_INTERFACE_CGI_DIR, and
	  ADMIN_INTERFACE_SCRIPT_DIR specify where you wish to install the campsite
	  html, cgi, and scripts. On a machine with virtual hosts you will likely
	  want to choose these directories carefully.

UNINSTALLATION
Follow the guide in the Campsite manual -- the uninstallation procedure for
FreeBSD is exactly the same.
